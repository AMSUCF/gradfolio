Here's a demonstration of replacing the main content. You should link from this content to at least one external site: for instance, you might mention your affiliation with [Texts & Technology](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/).

As you add content, watch your Markdown extension for errors - it should give you an update whenever you add something that doesn't align with the syntax. You can click the "!" in the triangle at the bottom of your VSC to see the error information and make changes, and you can also see your live preview and look for problems. Not all errors will be relevant to you, so decide how you feel about the results based on the preview!
